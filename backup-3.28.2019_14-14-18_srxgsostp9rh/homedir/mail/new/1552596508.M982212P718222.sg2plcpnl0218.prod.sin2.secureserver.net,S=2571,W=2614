An update to WordPress 5.1.1 (security release) is now available for the WordPress installations you are managing using Installatron. The following can be updated:

The changes for this version are:

This release also includes a pair of security fixes that handle how comments are filtered and then stored in the database. With a maliciously crafted comment, a WordPress post was vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

Props to Simon Scannell of RIPS Technologies who discovered this flaw independent of some work that was being done by members of the core security team. Thank you to all of the reporters for privately disclosing the vulnerabilities, which gave us time to fix them before WordPress sites could be attacked.

Other highlights of this release include:
* Hosts can now offer a button for their users to update PHP.
* The recommended PHP version used by the "Update PHP" notice can now be filtered.
* Several minor bug fixes.

Login to your web hosting control panel and navigate to the Installatron tool to update your installed applications.

End of report.
